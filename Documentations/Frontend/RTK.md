## Use Hooks in Components


### **Mutations**

[Triggering `updatePostOne` will affect the result in this component,  
but not the result in `ComponentTwo`, and vice-versa](https://github.com/Vladyslav-Team/frontend/blob/main/src/components/SigninPopup/SigninPopup.jsx#L13)

https://github.com/Vladyslav-Team/frontend/blob/main/src/components/SigninPopup/SigninPopup.jsx#L28

### **Queries**

[Using a query hook automatically fetches data and returns query values](https://github.com/Vladyslav-Team/frontend/blob/main/src/components/pages/Profile/Profile.jsx#L12)

### Frequently Used Query Hook Return Values[â€‹](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/usage/queries#frequently-used-query-hook-return-values "Direct link to heading")

The query hook returns an object containing properties such as the latest  `data`  for the query request, as well as status booleans for the current request lifecycle state. Below are some of the most frequently used properties. Refer to  [`useQuery`](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/api/created-api/hooks#usequery)  for an extensive list of all returned properties.

-   `data`  - The latest returned result regardless of hook arg, if present.
-   `currentData`  - The latest returned result for the current hook arg, if present.
-   `error`  - The error result if present.
-   `isUninitialized`  - When true, indicates that the query has not started yet.
-   `isLoading`  - When true, indicates that the query is currently loading for the first time, and has no data yet. This will be  `true`  for the first request fired off, but  _not_  for subsequent requests.
-   `isFetching`  - When true, indicates that the query is currently fetching, but might have data from an earlier request. This will be  `true`  for both the first request fired off, as well as subsequent requests.
-   `isSuccess`  - When true, indicates that the query has data from a successful request.
-   `isError`  - When true, indicates that the query is in an  `error`  state.
-   `refetch`  - A function to force refetch the query

In most cases, you will probably read  `data`  and either  `isLoading`  or  `isFetching`  in order to render your UI.
